# Creating Variables in the Right Place

<table>
<tr>
  <td>
    <strong>Mistake: </strong> typing <code>var</code> in multiple places
    <p>
    Remember that the `var` command creates a new variable without a value. This code contains a mistake:</p>
    <p><code>var count = count + 1</code></p>
    <p>It is telling the computer to create a <em>new variable</em> called <strong>count</strong> but it cannot compute <code>count + 1</code> because <code>count</code> doesn't have a value anymore.
    </p>

<tr>
  <td>
    <strong>Solution:</strong> remove  <code>var</code> from Line 4
    <p>
    Instead of trying to create a new variable inside the event handler, this code will now reference the one created in Line 1. Because we only created the variable once, all references to <code>count</code> refer to the same variable.
    </p>

For more advanced programs, it can actually be useful to declare variables <em>inside</em> an event function, but we won't need to do that for a while. <strong>For now, make sure to only use `var` once for each variable - preferably at the very top of your program so it's easy to keep track.</strong>
