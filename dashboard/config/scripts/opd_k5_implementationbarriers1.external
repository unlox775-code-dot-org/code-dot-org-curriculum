# Implementating CS Equitably
**Total Suggested Time:**

Code.org’s vision is “Every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education."  We recognize educators play a vital role in supporting equity in CS education.  Let's reflect on how we reach that vision begin with shared language and definitions to anchor your reflection about equity in CS.

## Shared Language for Equity in CS
* **Access:** Ensuring the right and opportunity for all students to learn and experience computer science.
* **Diversity:** Ensuring the students who learn computer science reflect the demographics of the larger school or community population.
* **Inclusion:** Creating learning environments that are accessible and welcoming of students’ identities, backgrounds, differences and perspectives without barriers or judgement.

## Making Meaning of Equity in CS
Equity in CS includes access, diversity, and inclusion.

* Equitable participation in computing education happens when
	* CS is available to all students (access)
	* Students participating in CS reflect the school’s demographics (diversity)
	* All students are engaged and learning CS (inclusion)

## Applying an Equity Lens

Let's go through an example of how to apply an equity lens to an approach to implementing CS with the following scenario.  Applying an equity lens helps examine and identify how to better support access, diversity, and inclusion when implementing CS in your school.

### Scenario
* **Context**
	* The school’s demographics include a majority of students who identify as African American/Black, followed by students who identify as White and Latinx/Hispanic. The school is in a low socioeconomic status community.

* **Implementation Approach**
	* Offering CS Fundamentals as a club only to students who like math, science, and gaming.

**Reflect on the following questions as you apply an equity lens to the scenario presented.**

### Questions for Applying an Equity Lens
* Who has access to CS in this scenario? Who does not?
* Who benefits from this implementation?
* What are the impacts of this implementation for those who have access and those who do not?
* What are recommendations for this scenario to better support access, diversity, and/or inclusion?

### Your Turn
Think about how you might implement CS and consider applying an equity lens to your implementation approach.
